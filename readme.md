 # Challenge Solution: Extending the selection logic

  > This tutorial was created with Unity version 2019.2. 

A challenge was issued at the end of the [How to select multiple objects based on the center of a collider](https://yecats.github.io/2019/10/26/Select-multiple-objects-based-on-mid-point-of-collider.html) tutorial to extend the mechanic by adding the ability to add/remove objects from an existing selection and clear the selection with a button click. This tutorial walks through how I chose to solve that challenge.

## Learning Outcomes

1. Apply knowledge gained from the tutorial series.

## Prerequisites
This is a continuation of the [How to select multiple objects based on the center of a collider](https://gamedev-resources.com/how-to-select-multiple-objects-based-on-the-center-of-a-collider/) tutorial, which is part two of the Input System series. You can skip previous tutorials by cloning the **starterProject** in the repository.

> Note: This tutorial will not cover previous topics in depth (such as how the Input Manager works). It is recommended that you start from the beginning of the series if you are missing any concepts.
